// Struggling with LeetCode medium problems in C++ is quite common, especially for those who are relatively new to programming or algorithmic problem-solving. Here are some steps you can take to improve your problem-solving skills and overcome challenges:

// 1. **Start with Basics:**
//    If you're finding medium problems difficult, make sure you have a strong grasp of the fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.).

// 2. **Understand the Problem:**
//    Carefully read and understand the problem statement. Break it down into smaller components and requirements. Clarify any doubts before attempting the solution.

// 3. **Solve Easy Problems First:**
//    Before tackling medium problems, work on a variety of easy and introductory problems. This will help you build confidence and understand common problem-solving patterns.

// 4. **Analyze the Problem:**
//    Identify the key insights required to solve the problem. Understand the problem's constraints and what the expected time and space complexities are.

// 5. **Plan Your Approach:**
//    Plan your approach before diving into coding. Decide on the algorithm or strategy you'll use to solve the problem. If you're unsure, start with a brute-force approach and then optimize it.

// 6. **Break It Down:**
//    Break the problem down into smaller sub-problems or steps. This can make the problem-solving process more manageable.

// 7. **Use Pseudocode:**
//    Write out your solution in pseudocode before implementing it in C++. This can help you think through the logic before getting into coding details.

// 8. **Implement Incrementally:**
//    Start coding step by step, testing each component as you go. This can help you catch errors early and build your solution iteratively.

// 9. **Debugging:**
//    If your solution isn't working as expected, use print statements, debuggers, or online tools to help you understand where things are going wrong.

// 10. **Review Existing Solutions:**
//     After attempting the problem, look at other people's solutions. Compare your approach with theirs and understand different ways to solve the problem. This can expand your problem-solving toolkit.

// 11. **Practice Regularly:**
//     Consistent practice is key to improving your problem-solving skills. Set aside dedicated time to solve problems regularly. Over time, you'll become more comfortable with different problem types and algorithms.

// 12. **Learn from Mistakes:**
//     Don't be discouraged by failure. Every unsuccessful attempt is an opportunity to learn and improve. Review your mistakes and understand why a particular approach didn't work.

// 13. **Seek Help:**
//     If you're stuck on a problem for an extended period, don't hesitate to seek help. Join programming communities, forums, or study groups to discuss problems, share insights, and learn from others.

// Remember, becoming proficient in algorithmic problem-solving takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your successes, and keep pushing forward. Overcoming challenges is an essential part of the learning process.
